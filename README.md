# Webcam Accessibility Checker

This Python script checks the accessibility of your webcam using OpenCV. It attempts to open the default camera (usually the built-in webcam) and reports whether it can be accessed successfully.

## ðŸ“‹ Features
- Verifies if the webcam is accessible
- Simple and lightweight code
- Uses OpenCV for camera handling

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install OpenCV if you haven't:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
3. run the script
   python python_web_cam.py

   Output

    If the webcam is accessible: Webcam is working
    If the webcam cannot be accessed: Cannot access webcam

Note
Ensure no other application is using the webcam while running the script.
